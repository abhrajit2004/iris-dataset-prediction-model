# Iris Dataset Prediction 
This project implements a machine learning model to predict the species of iris flowers using the classic Iris Dataset.

## Project Overview  
In this project, I have built and evaluated a classification model that predicts the species of an iris flower (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) based on its sepal and petal measurements. Typical workflow includes:
1. Loading the dataset
2. Data exploration & preprocessing (handling missing values, train/test split)
3. Training a classifier ( Naive-Bayes classifier )
4. Evaluating model accuracy
5. Making sample predictions

## Dataset  
The Iris Dataset is a widely used dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with the following columns: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and the species label.

## Features & Target  
1. **Features (input variables):**  
   - sepal length 
   - sepal width 
   - petal length
   - petal width
2. **Target (output variable):**
   - species (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica)
